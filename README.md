## Step motor control with ULN2003A Motor Driver
In the first example, a step motor is controlled by an stm32f4xx discovery. I could not drive the motor with low power MCU due to low ampere I presume.

## BMP180 Digital pressure sensor with stm32L0 low power MCU  
Barometric pressure sensors measure the absolute pressure of the air around them. This pressure varies with both the weather and altitude. 
Depending on how you interpret the data, you can monitor changes in the weather, measure altitude, or any other tasks that require an accurate pressure reading.

**Measuring Weather and Altitude**
The BMP180 was designed to accurately measure atmospheric pressure. 
Atmospheric pressure varies with both weather and altitude; you can measure both of these using this sensor. Here's how:

**What is Atmospheric Pressure?**

The definition of pressure is a force "pressing" on an area. A common unit of pressure is pounds per square inch (psi). 
One pound, pressing on one square inch, equals one psi. The SI unit is newtons per square meter, which are called pascals (Pa).

**Determining Altitude**

Since pressure varies with altitude, you can use a pressure sensor to measure altitude (with a few caveats).

The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1013.25 hPa (or mbar). This drops off to zero as you climb towards the vacuum of space. Because the curve of this drop-off is well understood, you can compute the altitude difference between two pressure measurements (p and p0) by using this equation:

**Tips and Tricks**
Things to Watch Out For

Give it the right voltage: The BMP180 will operate on voltages from 1.8V to 3.6V. We recommend operating it at 3.3V. Never connect the "+" header to voltages higher than 3.6V!. Note that it is safe to connect the SCA and SDL pins to an I2C port on a 5V Arduino, as the pullup resistors on the BMP180 board will keep the voltage below 3.6V.

**Give it air**: Remember that the BMP180 needs access to ambient air to measure its pressure, so don't put it in a sealed case. Providing a small vent hole should be adequate.

**But not too much air**: On the other hand, exposure to fast-moving air or wind can cause momentary pressure variations that will affect your readings. Shield the device from strong air currents.

**Keep it cool**: Because an accurate temperature reading is needed to measure the pressure, try not to expose the device to rapid temperature changes, and keep it away from nearby hot parts and other heat sources.

**Keep it dry**: The BMP180 is sensitive to moisture. Don't submerge it or allow it to contact liquid water.

**Don't blind it**: Surprisingly, the silicon within the BMP180 is sensitive to light, which can enter the device through the hole on the top of the chip. For maximum accuracy, shield the chip from ambient light.

### Acceleration Sensor (ADXL345)  with STM32L0 MCU
The ADXL345 is a small, thin, ultralow power, 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to Â±16 g. 
Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is accessible through either a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface.
Datasheet: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf

ADXL345 can be used for a whole bunch of things for example:
- 3-axis acceleration measurement
- Roll and Pitch measurement
- Single or double tap measurement
